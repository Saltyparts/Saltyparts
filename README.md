### Welcome to my GitHub 👋
Hey there, I'm Chay. I'm a professional systems engineer based out of San Francisco. I'm part of the core team at Fig. I used to lead the development of Fig for Windows but we're now searching for PMF. Despite this, I'm still responsible for all of our terminal rendering code which we hope to open-source soon.

If you're curious about computer graphics lessons, please email me directly.
