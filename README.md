### Welcome to my GitHub 👋
Hey there, I'm Chay. I love Rust but I tend to work all around the stack. I keep very close to myself but I'm very warm with my team and my friends and family besides.

I've been writing low-level Rust code for seven years.

At AWS, we built CodeWhisperer for command line.

At Fig, we created comprehensive autocomplete and AI completions for your existing shell.

We also created cicada.build, a way to write your CI/CD in TypeScript and run it locally as well as remote.
