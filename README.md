### Welcome to my GitHub 👋
Hey there, I'm Chay. I keep very close to myself but I'm very warm with my team and my friends and family besides. I've been writing low-level Rust code for seven years, and I'm secretly a skilled graphics software engineer and hobbiest indie dev.

At AWS, we built the shell and terminal integrations for Amazon Q Developer. (prev. CodeWhisperer for command line).

Before being acquired from Fig, me and my team created comprehensive autocomplete and AI completions for your existing shell.
