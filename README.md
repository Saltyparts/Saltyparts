### Welcome to my GitHub 👋
Hey there, I'm Chay. I love Rust but I tend to work all around the stack. I keep very close to myself but I'm very warm with my team at Fig and my friends and family besides.

We created comprehensive autocomplete and AI completions for your existing shell.

We also created cicada.build, a way to write your CI/CD in TypeScript and run it locally as well as remote.

In my own time I'm creating a game called Arise, an arcade FPS inspired by Quake. It's a game for you and your friends and offers a comprehensive modding framework written in Rust 🚀
